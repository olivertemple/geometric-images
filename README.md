# Geometric Images
Creates Various Geometric images using for loops
There are currently 3 different images that can be generated both in 2D and 3D. Colours can be changes and images of the same dimensions can be overlaid.

# Instilation
To install requirements, run:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

This will install matplotlib and pysimplegui
# Usage
Run the python code, and a pysimplegui will pop up, where you will be able to plot images, as seen below:

<img src="/resources/GUI example.png">
Select one of the 2D representations of the shapes (a brief description of what is selected will be show), tick the box to specify 2D or 3D. Next change the other fields, such as size and colour to the desired values (these can be left as default). For large sized images, a smaller line width is advised.
Press 'Plot' and the image will be shown. You can keep on plotting over the top of other images, however, if the dimensions are changes (e.g. from 3D to 2D) then the images will be cleared. The 'Reset' button can also be used to clear the image.
If you wish to save your image, click the save icon on the right of the toolbar at the bottom.
